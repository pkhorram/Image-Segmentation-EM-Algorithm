# Image-Segmentation-EM-Algorithm

* Image segmentation is implemented using the expectation maximization algorithm.<br/>
* The programming language used is MATLAB. 
<br/>
Cheetah.bmp provides the image of a cheetah walking in the dessert. The purpose of this project is to extract the image of cheeta from the background using a statistical technique known as expectation maximization. the ideal result (100 % accuracy) is shown in cheetah_mask.bmp.
